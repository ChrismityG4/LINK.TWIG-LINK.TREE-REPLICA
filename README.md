# LINK TWIG - My Link Tree Sapling

After completing my portfolio, the next thing I wanted to build was a Link Tree clone/replica.

With an aim to marketing myself, I will be using my Link Twig on my social media pages to direct people to my other platforms and to my portfolio.

This was my most enjoyable build to date.  It was super fun to get creative with the functionality and interaction quality.

I feel far more confident at this point with my coding skills after just 3 days.  I’m so pleased with Link Twig and can’t wait to deploy it.

Thanks for reading,

Chris Smith
